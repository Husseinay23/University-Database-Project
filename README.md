 üéì University Database Project

This project is a relational database design and implementation for a university management system. It includes SQL scripts to create, populate, and query the database.

## project description

The South Lebanon Relief Project aims to address the pressing needs of displaced families by developing a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS). This report details the project's inspiration, design, and schema. The DBMS encompasses entities such as donors, goods, warehouses, staff, transactions, vendors, equipment, families, and family members. The system is designed to streamline resource distribution, ensure data security, and support efficient management of donations and aid. By leveraging robust database principles and relationships, the project seeks to enhance the operational efficiency and responsiveness of relief efforts in conflict-affected areas.
